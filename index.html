      <h2>MySQL Section</h2>
      <h1>What is MySQL?</h1>

  <p>Effective data management is crucial, Database Management Systems (DBMS) are used in this situation. Software for managing, storing, and retrieving data from databases is called a database management system (DBMS).
  MySQL is one such popular DBMS. In this article, we will explore the importance of MySQL with its uses and discover why it is so important in databases.</p>

  <h2>Why use MySQL?</h2>

  <p>MySQL is a popular choice for managing relational databases for several reasons:</p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Open Source:</strong> MySQL is open-source software, which means itâ€™s free to use and has a large community of developers contributing to its improvement.</li>
    <li><strong>Relational:</strong> MySQL follows the relational database model, allowing users to organize data into tables with rows and columns, facilitating efficient data storage and retrieval.</li>
    <li><strong>Reliability:</strong> MySQL has been around for a long time and is known for its stability and reliability.</li>
    <li><strong>Performance:</strong> MySQL is optimized for performance, making it capable of handling high-volume transactions and large datasets efficiently.</li>
    <li><strong>Scalability:</strong> MySQL can scale both vertically and horizontally to accommodate growing data and user loads. You can add more resources to a single server or distribute the workload across multiple servers using techniques like sharding or replication.</li>
    <li><strong>Compatibility:</strong> MySQL is widely supported by many programming languages, frameworks, and tools. It offers connectors and APIs for popular languages like PHP, Python, Java, and more, making it easy to integrate with your existing software stack.</li>
    <li><strong>Security:</strong> MySQL provides robust security features to protect your data, including access controls, encryption, and auditing capabilities. With proper configuration, you can ensure that only authorized users have access to sensitive information.</li>
  </ul>

      <h2>PL/SQL Section</h2>
      <div class="container">
        <h1>What is PL/SQL?</h1>
        <p>PL/SQL is a block structured language that enables developers to combine the power of SQL with procedural statements. All the statements of a block are passed to the Oracle engine all at once, which increases processing speed and decreases traffic.</p>
    
        <h2>Basics of PL/SQL</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>PL/SQL stands for Procedural Language extensions to the Structured Query Language (SQL).</li>
          <li>PL/SQL is a combination of SQL along with the procedural features of programming languages.</li>
          <li>Oracle uses a PL/SQL engine to processes the PL/SQL statements.</li>
          <li>PL/SQL includes procedural language elements like conditions and loops. It allows declaration of constants and variables, procedures and functions, types and variable of those types and triggers.</li>
        </ul>
    
        <h2>Features of PL/SQL</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>PL/SQL is basically a procedural language, which provides the functionality of decision making, iteration and many more features of procedural programming languages.</li>
          <li>PL/SQL can execute a number of queries in one block using single command.</li>
          <li>One can create a PL/SQL unit such as procedures, functions, packages, triggers, and types, which are stored in the database for reuse by applications.</li>
          <li>PL/SQL provides a feature to handle the exception which occurs in PL/SQL block known as exception handling block.</li>
          <li>Applications written in PL/SQL are portable to computer hardware or operating system where Oracle is operational.</li>
          <li>PL/SQL Offers extensive error checking.</li>
